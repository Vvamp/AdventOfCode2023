# Vvamp's Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Welcome to my github repo where I share my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. As a passionate programmer and embedded software student, I'm tackling these puzzles to sharpen my skills and have fun along the way!

I'll be making my solutions in C#, due to the beautiful functionality of LINQ.
I made the first day in python, but redid it in C# later on.

## 👨‍🏫 Teachers

Unfortunately, I won't be competing for INNO points. The reason is that I can't make it to the required classes on tuesdays.

## 🌟 Challenges and Completion Times

Below is the list of challenges I've completed along with the time it took me to solve each. I'm using a system of golden and silver stars to indicate my performance on each day, similar to the AOC system.
The times are from opening the puzzle to submition. The times are not cumulative(so if part 2 has a time of 1 hour, it took me 1 hour for only part 2. Part 1 is excluded).
The times are in the format `HH:mm:ss` (Although seconds are left out).

- **Day 1:** ⭐⭐ - `00:30:00` / `01:22:00`
- **Day 2:** ⭐⭐ - `01:06:00` / `00:14:00`
- **Day 3:** ⭐⭐ - `00:56:00` / `00:08:00`
- _Other Days In Progress_
